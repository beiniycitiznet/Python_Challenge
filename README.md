# Python: PyBank & PyPoll

## PyBank

Creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

### Instruction

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.



## PyPoll

Helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process

### Instruction

* Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote
  
* Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
  
  
## Consideration 
  
* The datasets are quite large, creating scripts in Python can provide us with more robust options for handling "big data"

* Import modules like csv to read and write files in various formats; to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures
